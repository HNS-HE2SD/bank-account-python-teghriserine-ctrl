# Bank Account System - Python OOP Exercise

## Description
This project is an educational Python program to practice **object-oriented programming** concepts such as:

- Class design and **attribute encapsulation**
- **Object composition** (Account objects contain Client objects)
- **Interaction between classes** through methods
- Implementing **credit, debit, and transfer operations**

The original classes (`Client` and `Account`) are provided in `TW_2_3.py`. Additional exercises allow you to extend functionality, including transaction history, multiple accounts per client, and input validation.

## Files

- `TW_2_3.py`: Contains the base `Client` and `Account` classes.
- Attachments (PDF / instructions) may also be included for reference.
